                As a part of the propulsion department of AQUILO Student Rocket Team, I have been involved in the
                design, manufacturing, and testing of solid rocket motors.

                AQUILO, a passionate team, dedicated to passing down rocketry knowledge and pushing the limits of student
                innovation has been my stepping mile into field of aerospace engineering enhancing my knowledge
                regarding propulsion and component design. Major milestone up to this point for the team has been AQUILO
                VIII.S rocket launch where our work has been rewarded. <strong>Check out AQUILO VIII.S launch video!</strong>

                Responsible engineer standing behind HEI Head-End Ignition project. Project gave me the oportunity to delve deep
                into propulsion concepts in rocket engineering. My project advances the teams capabilities in terms of
                possible ignition of dual stage rocket designs with current motor achitecture.
                HEI boosts current motor ignition time which as a result brings higher overall propulsion ISP (specific impulse).

                I have used my machining skills to produce various components for our rocket motors. From endcaps to nozzles, 
                I have been involved in the manufacturing process of critical parts of our propulsion system. 
                This has given me a hands-on experience with various manufacturing techniques and materials used in aerospace engineering.
                But things dont stop at propulsion, I have also been involved in manufacturing of other structural components of VIII.S rocket.
                From body struts to retaining rings, I have enjoyed the process of turning a design into a physical part that was be used in our rocket.
