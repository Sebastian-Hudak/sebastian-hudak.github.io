                Work at CAE is not only about working with high-tech simulators,
                but also about maintaining the facilities and ensuring that everything runs smoothly.
                From software, hardware visual and audio systems to hydraulic motion systems, there is always something to do.
                Hands-on work is a big part of my job, and I enjoy the variety of tasks that come with it.
